# Iris Flower Classification - Supervised Machine Learning Project

## Overview
This project focuses on building a supervised machine learning model to classify iris species based on their physical features such as sepal and petal length/width. The model is trained using the classic **Iris dataset**, which is widely used in pattern recognition and classification tasks.

## Dataset
The dataset used is the Iris dataset, which contains 150 records of iris flowers, with the following features:
- **Sepal Length**
- **Sepal Width**
- **Petal Length**
- **Petal Width**
- **Species** (target variable: Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica)

## Key Features
- **Data Preprocessing**:
  - Loaded and explored the dataset using Pandas.
  - Normalized the feature data for better model performance.
  - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
  
- **Model Development**:
  - Implemented multiple classification algorithms such as:
    - **Logistic Regression**
    - **Decision Trees**
    - **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**
  - Evaluated models based on accuracy and confusion matrix.

- **Performance**:
  - Achieved a classification accuracy of 1.0 on the test set.
  - The model predicts the iris species with high accuracy by learning from the features.

- **Visualization**:
  - Visualized feature relationships through count plots and decision trees.
  - Visualized decision boundaries and feature importance for model interpretability.

## Project Structure
- **Final_project_SML.ipynb**: The Jupyter Notebook containing the entire code for loading data, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.
- **Iris.csv**: The Iris dataset
  
## How to Use
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open the `Final_project_SML.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook.

4. Explore the visualizations and decision boundaries generated in the notebook.

## Results
- The model successfully classifies iris species with a high degree of accuracy.
- The most significant features for classification were **Petal Length** and **Petal Width**, as indicated by feature importance analysis.

## Libraries and Tools
- **Python 3.x**
- **Pandas** for data manipulation
- **Scikit-Learn** for machine learning algorithms
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for data visualization

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how machine learning algorithms can be applied to a well-known dataset to achieve meaningful results. The Iris dataset is simple yet effective for demonstrating the basics of supervised learning, from data preprocessing to model evaluation.
